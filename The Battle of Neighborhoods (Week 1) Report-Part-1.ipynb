They can do grocery shopping, dine at restaurants, shop at the various \nfashion outlets, watch movies and perform many more activities. Shopping malls are like a one-stop \ndestination for all types of shoppers. For retailers, the central location and the large crowd at the \nshopping malls provides a great distribution channel to market their products and services. Property \ndevelopers are also taking advantage of this trend to build more shopping malls to cater to the \ndemand. As a result, there are many shopping malls in the city of Kuala Lumpur and many more are \nbeing built. Opening shopping malls allows property developers to earn consistent rental income.  Of \ncourse, as with any business decision, opening a new shopping mall requires serious consideration \nand is a lot more complicated than it seems. Particularly, the location of the shopping mall is one of \nthe most important decisions that will determine whether the mall will be a success or a failure.  \n</p>"

The \nlocal newspaper The Malay Mail also reported in March last year that the true occupancy rates in \nmalls may be as low as 40 per cent in some areas, quoting a Financial Times (FT) article cataloguing \nthe country's continued obsession with building more shopping space despite chronic oversupply."
